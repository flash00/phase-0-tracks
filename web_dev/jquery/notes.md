Plan for learning as much about jQuery as possible in 2 hours.

1) Bookmark and review jQuery cheatsheet.
Very helpful. Went for the jQuery for dummies sheet and it gave me a good idea of what jQuery is all about. Looks fun to try.

2) See what cohort members have posted on Slack for jQuery.
Not so helpful. No one has posted anything.

3) Google popular jQuery uses and features to get an idea of what you can do with it.
Less helpful. Too broad - lots of distracting but not informative results.

3) Google jQuery tutorials/videos. Pick one or two to try out.
 Code along with tutorial.
 W3 wins again. Very helpful introduction to jQuery especially explaining how to "install" jQuery which confused me originally.

 4) Test things that you learn whenever you are about to switch resources or have completed a section of a tutorial.
 With W3 you try things as you go along.

 5) Break every half hour for 5 minutes.
 Breaks came naturally (phonecall and tea) so this worked very well and I restarted with fresh eyes.
