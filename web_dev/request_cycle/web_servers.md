What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
A Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system, deriving much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s.
The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.
There are nine major tenets to the Linux philosophy:
Small is Beautiful
Each Program Does One Thing Well
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
Make Every Program a Filter

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)?
A VPS is space on a machine that is isolated and acts as if it is a stand alone server. You would pay a fee to have it hosted by a company.
What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
Easy creation and configuration of server and you don't need to physically store it.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Root has administrative access automatically. If you run software with a bug in it as root. The bug could use root's administrative access instead of being limited as a non-administrative user.
