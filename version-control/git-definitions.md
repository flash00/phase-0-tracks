# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It's the management of changes to a project and is useful because you can go back to points on a project prior to certain changes if you want.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is where you branch off a copy of a project to work on a particular feature which you can later merge back into the master.  This allows multiple people to work on multiple branches simultaneously and later merge them into the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point of a project.  A good commit message describes the change made to the project at that point.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when two branches made changes to the same line of code. Someone needs to decide which change to go with before it can be merged with the master.
