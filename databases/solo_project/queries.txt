3|El Capitan|1952|false|3
4|Glass Tears|1932|false|3
5|Fountain|1917|true|2

1|Mona Lisa|1503|true|1
2|Cupid's Span|2002|true|2
3|El Capitan|1952|false|3
4|Glass Tears|1932|false|3

4|Glass Tears|1932|true|3
5|Fountain|1917|true|2

4.Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT artwork.name, department.name FROM artwork JOIN department ON artwork.department_id = department.id;

Mona Lisa|Painting
Cupid's Span|Sculpture
El Capitan|Photography
Glass Tears|Photography
Fountain|Sculpture
The Starry Night|Painting

5.Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE from artwork WHERE name="Glass Tears";
sqlite> SELECT artwork.name, department.name FROM artwork JOIN department ON artwork.department_id = department.id;

Cupid's Span|Sculpture
El Capitan|Photography

RELEASE 3:

1.There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? 
Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join.

Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Yes.

sqlite> SELECT artwork.name, department.name FROM artwork JOIN department ON artwork.department_id = department.id AND artwork.name="The Starry Night";
The Starry Night|Painting

Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future? Yes. Say no to Venn diagrams. https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/

2.Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

sqlite> SELECT department.name FROM department LEFT JOIN artwork ON department.id = artwork.department_id;
