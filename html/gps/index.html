<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
To provide meaning and make the page more readable and accessible to people with disabilities.
Which ones do you see as most useful?
The <header> and <footer> elements are most practicle - shouldn't every page have a header and footer? The <nav> element seems almost mandatory for the convenience of the user. The <section> element is most versitile and really helpful for organizing the html page for someone viewing he code. <main>, <article> and <aside> seem more specific to their circumstance and therefor less frequently used.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The order they appear in the code page - reading top to bottom left to right.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
I learned how to make snippets. Which is awesome. I made an unordered list snippet and I'm going to make a table one.
Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Yes, I'm going to create a table snippet. And I'll make a snippet for anything that requires a lot of repetitive typing. Our helpful guide, Ryan, also suggested Emmet for handy snippets to use with Sublime.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
I had trouble understanding the use of the <aside> element.
How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Using the <asise> element in this GPS clarified it's purpose a lot. Discussing it with my guide and partner and researching it online further clarified it's uses.
